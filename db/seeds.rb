(Since modern tastes prefer salt & pepper, you may add these at this time if you wish.) The mixture should be the proper consistency with which to make meatballs.
Bring the broth to a soft boil.
Have a bowl of egg whites next to you while you make the meatballs. Dip your hands in the egg white before making each ball, which should be the size of an orange, or an oingnun, an onion.
Or, if you prefer, make the meatballs and dip each one in the egg white just before boiling.
Gently boil the meatballs in the broth until just done. Remove and drain.
If it is possible for you to spit roast the meatballs, in a rotisserie or a modern oven, then do so, placing the meat on your skewers, leaving a slight gap between each ball -  they must not be touching or you will have difficulty in thoroughly coloring them later on.
Roast until they are just beginning to brown.
If you cannot spit roast, place the meatballs on a baking sheet and roast in an oven until they are just beginning to brown.
Thoroughly coat the meatballs in egg white. If using skewers, either dip & roll them in egg white, still on the skewer, or use a pastry brush to paint on the egg; if using a baking sheet, dip each meatball in egg or use a pastry brush.
Return to the heat just long enough for the egg white to set and turn white; this will take only half a minute or so. DO not overcook the white, as it will turn brown. This makes the inner white coating of the orange peel.
Now coat the meatballs in the egg yolk, the same manner in which you did the whites. (For a brighter, deeper orange color, add a few drops of yellow food coloring to the yolks.)
Return to the heat just long enough for the egg yolk to set; again, this will take only half a minute or so. DO not overcook, as the yolk will turn brown and spoil the effect.
